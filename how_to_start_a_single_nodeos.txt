This article aims to build a stand-alone nodeos same as the producer.


1.Your config.ini seems no way to be changed , even using --config ./config.ini-> always be the ~/.local/share/xxx/nodeos/config/config.ini
  Your data-dir can be assigned as --data-dir ./lypdata, default will using  ~/.local/share/xxx/nodeos/data

2. How to config your node as signle node and let cli use:
       a. config.ini add plugin as:
                plugin = baic::producer_plugin
		plugin = baic::chain_plugin
		plugin = baic::history_plugin
		plugin = baic::net_plugin
		plugin = baic::http_plugin
		plugin = baic::chain_api_plugin
		plugin = baic::wallet_api_plugin
       
	b. config.ini set http-server-address = 127.0.0.1:20188, to let cli can access.
	
	c. config.ini set producer:
		producer-name = xxx,  to be as the producer
		enable-stale-production = true, to let single produce block, multi-nodes need to be false.
